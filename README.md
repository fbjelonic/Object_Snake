# Object_Snake

Another Snake Game for Linux OS, this time in an object oriented Way.

## Starting the game with Linux

1. Open the Release folder in a Terminal.
2. Type `./Snake_Object`  and press enter.

## Building the project

If it does not work out of the box, you should copy paste my code into your favorite C++ IDE and build it there. This would be the easiest way.
